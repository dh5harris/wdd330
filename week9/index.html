        Every JS enviroment has a global object. Any variables that are created
        in the global scope are properties of the this object, the window object
        in the browser. The Browser Object Model (or BOM) is a collection of
        properties and methods that contain information about the browser and
        the computer screen. There is no offical standard for the BOM, but a lot
        of the methods and properties are supported by all major browsers. To
        refer to a global variable, you do not need the name of the global
        object before the variable name, just the variable name.
      </p>
      <p>
        The alert(), confirm(), and prompt() are part of the window object. All
        three stop the execution of the program until the are answered by the
        user. The alert() method displays a dialog box. The message is provided
        as an argument to the method. The confirm() method, like the alert(),
        shows a message that is the argument, gives the user the option of 'OK'
        or 'Cancel'. The prompt() method shows a message, that is provided by
        argument, and an input field that allows the user to enter text. That
        text is returned a string when the user clicks 'OK' or null when
        'Cancel' is clicked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The navigator property gives information about the browser and the
        operating system that is being used. The location property has
        information about the URL of the current page. The href property returns
        the full URL as a string. The history property has access about previous
        visited pages and the current session. The window screen object has
        information about the size of the screen. This is useful for mobile. The
        Document Object has properties that deal with the page. The write()
        method - *"DO NOT USE"* - can write a string to a page. Use something
        more in the lines of .textContent or something. Cookies is a small file
        that are save on a user's computer. Cookies are limited to 4KB. can only
        be read by a web page from the domain that set the cookie. Cookies help
        with personalizing user experience. LocalStorage is handling more of
        this. Cookies use a name/value pairs seperated by semicolons. Cookies
        are session cookies by default, but they can be made to be persistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The window object has some timing functions. The setTimeout() accepts a
        callback to a function as the first parameter. The second parameter is a
        number in milliseconds. The setTimeout() returns an integer, which is
        the ID to reference that particular timeout. The setInterval() works
        like the setTimeout() expect that it will repeatedly invoke the callback
        function after every given milliseconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Animation. You can use the setTimeout and setInterval methods to animate
        elements on a web page. The requestAnimationFrame() came along to make
        improvements like not running the animation when the tab is inactive. It
        provides a smoother performance. With JS able to preform animations, it
        is usually best to let CSS to handle animation instead of JS.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML APIs. With HTML being now a 'Living Standard', you can use a site
        called CanIUse.com to see if elements are compatible to what browsers.
        The data- attribute is new to HTML5. The data- attribute is a way to
        embed data in a web page that are ignored by the browser. Their sole
        prupose is to be used by a JS program. They must start with data-,
        contain lowercase letters, numbers, dots, colons, or underscores, and
        include an optional string value. Each element has a dataset property
        that can be used to access any data- attributes it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML 5 APIs help to gain access to hardware. One of the popular APIs is
        LocalStorage. LocalStorage is like cookies but has few restrictions,
        more storage capacity, and is easier to use. Some differences are that
        localStorage information is not shared with the server on every request,
        is available on multiple windows of the browser, the size limit is
        greater that 4KB, and the data is not automatically expire as it does
        with cookies. The information is stored in key/value pairs and the
        values can only be strings. To save an object to localStorage, you have
        to use JSON.stringify() to save it as a string. To retrieve the JSON
        string, you use JSON.parse() to return it to a JSON object. Geolocation
        API is used to obtain the geographical location of the device. You can
        find their exact location, filter places nearby, and can measure the
        user's location and speed (very helpful on mobile).
      </p>
      <p>
        Websockets allow for two-way communication with a server, also knwon as
        push messaging. The notification API allows you to show messages using
        the system's notifications. Before you can send notifications, you have
        to get permission from the user. An advantage of the notification api is
        that the notifications will still display even if the tab is not the
        current tab. The multimedia api is for controlling the playback of clips
        using JS. It has the play() to start playing a clip, pause() to pause
        the current position. The currentTime property is used to jump to
        another part of the clip.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shims and Polyfills are libraries of code that allow you to use apis as
        usual because they fill in the necessary code that is not provided
        natively by the user's browser. A shim is a piece of code that adds some
        missing functionality to a browser. A polyfill is a shim that achieves
        the same functionality, while also using the API commands that would be
        used if the feature was supported natively.
