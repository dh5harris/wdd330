      <p>
        I made a lot of flash cards using the program Anki to help me review
        what I am learning. This is for my previous classes also.
      </p>

      <p>
        Map is an ordered list of key/value pairs. Set is an ordered list also,
        but they cannot have duplicate values.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions are small chuck of code that can be called later in the
        program. They help eleminate repetitive code. All functions return a
        value. That is usually done with a return statement. Default parameter's
        should be listed after the non-default parameters so that the default
        parameters don't have to be entered. const and let variables do not
        hoist.
      </p>
      <p>You can chain array iterators together.</p>
      <p>Questions:</p>
      <p>What are symbols and why are they important?</p>
      <p>Is a map like a dictionary in Python?</p>
      <p>Sets and Maps. When would be an idea time to use those?</p>
      <p>
        I am having a hard time understanding the parameters for the callback
        function for the array iterators like forEach(), map(), etc. The
        element, index, and array parameters. Are those parameters required or
        optional? I have looked at past examples from the WDD 230 and CSE 121B
        (JavaScript) classes. I don't see where or how those parameters are used.
        <p>One of those examples we have favFoods.forEach(food) => { code block }. </p>
