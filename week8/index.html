        CSS transform property lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew
        any element on the page. The transform property does not impact the flow
        of the document. The value of the transform property is one or more
        transform functions. The functions are separated by spaces and applied
        in order they are given. The translation function allows you to move the
        elements left, right, up, or down. The scale function allows you to grow
        or shrink an element horizontally and or vertically. The default
        behavior of a scaled element grows outwards or shrinks inward towards
        its center. The rotation function rotates an element clockwise of
        counterclockwise. The default point of origin is the element's center.
        The angle value is given in degrees, grads, radians, or turns. The skew
        function will skew the element on it's x or y axis or both. Transitions
        allow the values to change over time. They provide simple animations.
        CSS animations allow you to control each step of an animation via
        @keyframes. Keyframes define the starting and ending points for a smooth
        transitions. You can add multiple points for the animation.

        The canvas api allows us to draw anything that we can imagine by using
        JavaScript. We can draw shapes, lines, arces, text, gradients, and
        patterns. Use add a canvas element to the page. You need to set the
        height and width on the canvas element to define how large the
        coordinate system is. The default is 300 width and 150 height. The
        Canvas coordinate system is the same as the window coordinate system.
        The top-left is 0,0 and the bottom right is x-max, y-max. You can redraw
        images into canvas. You can even manipulate video with canvas. Canvas
        does have accessibility concerns, because it lacks accessibility. It
        doesn't create a DOM node, is not text-based, and is basically invisible
        to tools like screen readers. SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics. Vector
        images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink them.
        SVG can do many of the same thing that canvas can do, including drawing
        paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns. SVG is availible via the
        DOM. So screen readers can see what is present in an SVG object. Drawing
        simple shapes is easier with SVG.

        The Drag and Drop API allows us to specify that certain elements are
        draggable and what elements are dragged over and dropped onto other
        elements. To make an element draggable, you add the draggable attribute
        and set the value to'true'.Draggable is not boolean, so you have to
        explicitly set it to true.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Is canvas simialar to canvas with Python? I have used it in the
          programming with functions class, CSE 111.
