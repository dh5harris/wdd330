        The input element has new attributes in HTML 5. The autofocus attribute
        give the element focus when the page loads. The placeholder attribute is
        similiar to the HTML placeholder attribute. The maxlength attribute
        limits the number of character that can be entered. There are several
        input fields.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Text. The input type='text', which is for a short piece of text. The
          type='text' attribute isn't required, it is the default value, but for
          best practices it be used.

        <li>
          Hidden field. The input type='hidden' are not displayed by the
          browser. They do have a 'value' sttribute that can contain information
          that is sent with the form. Note: the information in the hidden input
          is not secret, it is visable in the HTML. Don't not use for sensitive
          data.
        </li>
        <li>

        Form validation is the process of checking whether a user has entered
        the information into a form correctly. Examples of form validation are:
        a required field is completed, a valid email address was entered, a
        number entered for a numerical data, a password that has certain
        requirements. Validation can happen on the client and server sides. It
        is recommended to use both client-side and server-side validation. You
        can use the preventDefault() method to stop the form from being
        submitted. A button can be disabled by using the disable attribute, then
        use a JavaScript function to keep it disabled or enable it.

        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Encapsulation is where code is kept
        hidden from the user and the only things that are necessary are
        available to the user. Like a transmission in a vehicle, The only one
        thing that is necessary to the user is the shifter. Polymorphism is
        where an objects have the same method but have the ability to overwrite
        what the method does. Inheritence is where the child class inherits the
        methods and properties of the parent class.
      </p>
      <p>
        The literal noation to create a class is <br /><span class="code"
          >const variableName = {code goes here}</span
        ><br />Another way to create a class is with a constructor function;
        <br /><span class="code">
          const variableName = function(parameter=defaultValue)
          {parameters,methods, and code goes here}</span
        ><br />
        ES6 gives the new class declaration syntax, which basically the same is
        the constructor way, but you use the keyword class with the name of the
        class. The class name is capitalized. Classes must be define before they
        can be constructed, because they are not hoisted. The constructor method
        is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object
        instance of that class.

        A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and
        methods that can be usd in other files and modules. Code in a module
        should have a single purpose, and group together functions with distinct
        functionality. ES6 modules - all code in modules is always in 'strict
        mode' without the need to 'use strict'. A module has its own global
        scope. The value of 'this' in the top level of a module is undefined,
        rather than the global object. You can't use HTML-style comments in
        modules, didn't know JS could have HTML-style comments. A ES6 module is
        a just a normal JS file, but uses the keyword 'export' to specify any
        values or functions that are to be made available from the module. For
        it to be imported to the 'main JS file', us use the 'import' keyword
        then { moduleName } from 'path/module.js';. This is the same with
        functions. When importing multiple functions/variables, the names are
        inside the {} with commas seperating them. To import everything from a
        module import * as stats from 'path/moduleName.js;'

      <h2>Questions:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the best way to access form elements? The book (under 'A
            Searching Example') gives some examples of targeting the form and
            the input.
            <span class="code">
              "const form = document.forms['search']; <br />
              "const input = form.elements.searchInput;" <br />
              "input.addEventListener('focus', () =>alert('focused'),
              false);"</span
            >
            The addEventListener would give an
            <span class="code">
              "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read the properties of
              undefined"</span
            >
            which was referenced to the input getting focus. When I changed the
            const input to
            <span class="code">
              "const input = document.querySelector('input');"</span
            >
            then everything seemed to work as it should. So should we target the
            input with a querySelector or the form.elements.searchInput? Just
            wondering.
