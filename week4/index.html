        The input element has new attributes in HTML 5. The autofocus attribute
        give the element focus when the page loads. The placeholder attribute is
        similiar to the HTML placeholder attribute. The maxlength attribute
        limits the number of character that can be entered. There are several
        input fields.

        Form validation is the process of checking whether a user has entered
        the information into a form correctly. Examples of form validation are:
        a required field is completed, a valid email address was entered, a
        number entered for a numerical data, a password that has certain
        requirements. Validation can happen on the client and server sides. It
        is recommended to use both client-side and server-side validation. You
        can use the preventDefault() method to stop the form from being
        submitted.

      <h2>Questions:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the best way to access form elements? The book (under 'A
            Searching Example') gives some examples of targeting the form and
            the input.
            <span class="code">
              "const form = document.forms['search']; <br />
              "const input = form.elements.searchInput;" <br />
              "input.addEventListener('focus', () =>alert('focused'),
              false);"</span
            >
            The addEventListener would give an
            <span class="code">
              "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read the properties of
              undefined"</span
            >
            whch was referenced to the input getting focus. When I changed the
            const input to
            <span class="code">
              "const input = document.querySelector('input');"</span
            >
            then everything seemed to work as it should. So should we target the
            input with a querySelector or the form.elements.searchInput? Just
            wondering.
