        Liniting tolls such as JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test
        the quality of JavaScript code. They are designed to highlight any
        sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and recommend style
        conventions

        Feature detection is using an if statement to see if that feature is
        available to the browser. Caniuse.com is a great resource to look if
        browsers have certain features. Debugging is the process of finding
        errors in our code. Breakpoints is a place to stop the process of the
        program and to see what values a in variables at that point in the code.
        Using console.log() will log to the console the value of a variable at
        different stages of the program.You can debug using Web browsers. You
        can add breakpoints through the browser under the sources tab in dev
        tools. You can add the 'debugger' command to a function. When the
        function gets to the debugger command, it will automatically open the
        browser's console so you can see the value of the variable.
        <em>Remember</em> to remove all debugger commands before shipping.

        When JavaScript "throws an exception" is when there is an error in the
        code. There are 8 error objects built-in to the JavaScript engine:
        error, EvalError - not really used, RangeError - when a number is
        outside an allowable range of values, ReferenceError - for an item that
        doesn't exist, SyntaxError - for error in the code's syntax, TypeError -
        for an error in the type of value used, URIError - for a problem
        encoding or decoding the URI, InternalError - a non-standard error.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript creates an error object with two properties: name and
        message. The name property is the error consturctor such as 'Error' or
        'ReferenceError'. The message property is a description of the error,
        and stack - a stack trace for that error.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can throw your own exceptions by using a throw error object when you
        think there will be an error of some sort. The code you want to try or
        test goes into a try block. try { code to 'try' or test}. If there is an
        error, it can be passed to a catch block (after the try block) that
        defines a code block to handle any error. catch(err) {code to handle the
        errors}. The finally block, comes after the catch block, runs a block of
        code regardless of the try result. finally {code to run}.

        I could not find a good definition for what strict mode is exactly?
        Sloppy mode vs strict mode? Does it have to do with JavaScript being a
        loosely typed language and strict mode is to make more strongly typed?
