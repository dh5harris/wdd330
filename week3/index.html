      <h2>Notes:</h2>
      <p>
        The Chrome Developer Tools console is very handy with the intelliscene.
        Need to use and play more with it. When using the hasOwnProperty('city')
        that the property is in quotes. You have to be careful when changing
        variables that share the same object in memory because you are changing
        the object's value. This doesn't happen with primitive values.
      </p>
      <p>
        The this keyword refers to the object that it is within. "Namespacing is
        the act of wrapping a set of entities, variables, functions, objects
        under a single umbrella term." - flaviocopes.com. This helps prevent
        reusing names that might have been used somewhere else in the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        JSON - JavaScript Object Notation. A popular data storage format. A few
        things to remember.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Property names must be in double quotes</li>
        <li>
          Permitted values are double-quoted strings, numbers, true, false,
          null, arrays, and objects
        </li>
        <li>Functions are not permitted values.</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The parse() method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a
          JavaScript object.
        </li>
        <li>
          The stringify() method does the opposite of parse(). It takes a
          JavaScript object and returns it as a string of JSON data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Math Object is built into JavaScript. Think of the Math library for
        Python except that it does not need to be imported.
      </p>
      <p>Most Math methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          .abs() returns the absolute value of a number. If positive, it will be
          positive. If negative, will be positive.
        </li>
        <li>
          .ceil() rounds a number up to the next integer, if necessary, and
          returns the result.
        </li>
        <li>
          .floor() rounds a number down to the next integer, if necessary, and
          returns the result.
        </li>
        <li>.round() will round a number to the nearest integer.</li>
        <li>
          .trunc() returns the integer-part of a number - that is, it get
          trunvated at the decimal point.
        </li>
        <li>.exp() will raise a number to the power of Eular's constant.</li>
        <li>
          .pow() will rasie any number (the first argument) to the power of
          another number (the second argument).
        </li>
        <li>.sqrt() returns the positive root of a number.</li>
        <li>.cbrt() returns the cube root of a number. New to ES6.</li>
        <li>.max() returns the maximum nuber from its arguments.</li>
        <li>.min() returns the minimum number from the given arguments.</li>
        <li>.random() creates a random number between 0 and 1</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Regular Expressions or RegExp, is used to search strings for matches to
        a pattern.

      <h2>Questions:</h2>
      <p>
        Is "this" similiar to "self" used to define methods in Python classes?
        It seems to be.
