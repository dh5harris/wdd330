      <h2>Notes:</h2>
      <p>
        The Chrome Developer Tools console is very handy with the intelliscene.
        Need to use and play more with it. When using the hasOwnProperty('city')
        that the property is in quotes. You have to be careful when changing
        variables that share the same object in memory because you are changing
        the object's value. This doesn't happen with primitive values.
      </p>
      <p>
        The this keyword refers to the object that it is within. "Namespacing is
        the act of wrapping a set of entities, variables, functions, objects
        under a single umbrella term." - flaviocopes.com. This helps prevent
        reusing names that might have been used somewhere else in the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        JSON - JavaScript Object Notation. A popular data storage format. A few
        things to remember.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Property names must be in double quotes</li>
        <li>
          Permitted values are double-quoted strings, numbers, true, false,
          null, arrays, and objects
        </li>
        <li>Functions are not permitted values.</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The parse() method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a
          JavaScript object.
        </li>
        <li>
          The stringify() method does the opposite of parse(). It takes a
          JavaScript object and returns it as a string of JSON data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Math Object is built into JavaScript. Think of the Math library for
        Python except that it does not need to be imported. Also the Date object
        is built into JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>Most Math methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          .abs() returns the absolute value of a number. If positive, it will be
          positive. If negative, will be positive.
        </li>
        <li>
          .ceil() rounds a number up to the next integer, if necessary, and
          returns the result.
        </li>
        <li>
          .floor() rounds a number down to the next integer, if necessary, and
          returns the result.
        </li>
        <li>.round() will round a number to the nearest integer.</li>
        <li>
          .trunc() returns the integer-part of a number - that is, it get
          trunvated at the decimal point.
        </li>
        <li>.exp() will raise a number to the power of Eular's constant.</li>
        <li>
          .pow() will rasie any number (the first argument) to the power of
          another number (the second argument).
        </li>
        <li>.sqrt() returns the positive root of a number.</li>
        <li>.cbrt() returns the cube root of a number. New to ES6.</li>
        <li>.max() returns the maximum nuber from its arguments.</li>
        <li>.min() returns the minimum number from the given arguments.</li>
        <li>.random() creates a random number between 0 and 1</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Regular Expressions or RegExp, is used to search strings for matches to
        a pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use the nodeType property to find out what type of node it is.
        The nodeName property is used to find the name of the element.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          getElementById() returns the element with the specified id attribute.
          If no element with the id provided, null is returned.
        </li>
        <li>
          getElementsByTagName() returns all the elements with the tag name
          provided in a node list.
        </li>
        <li>
          getElementsByClassName() returns a node list of all the elements that
          have the class name specified.
        </li>
        <li>
          querySelector() allows you to use CSS notation to get the
          <em>first</em> element in the document that matches the CSS selector
          provided.
        </li>
        <li>
          querySelectorAll() also can use CSS noation. Returns a node list of
          <em>all</em> the elements in the document that matches the CSS query
          selector.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The querySelector() method can be called on any element, rather than
        just document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Text, whether actual text, '', or a \n, has its own node called a text
        node. You can use the getAttribute() method returns the value of the
        arrtibute provided as the argument. You can set or change an attirbute
        using the setAttribute() method. setAttribute() requires two parameters,
        the attribute and the value it is being set to. The attribute and value
        are in qoutes and seperated by a comma. You can use .classList.add() to
        add more classes to an element. The values are in qoutes and seperated
        by commas if there are multiple classes being added. To remove classes
        from an element use .classList.remove(). The toggle() method is useful
        to add a class to an element if it doesn't have it already, and will
        remove that class if it already has it. Very useful with buttons that
        goes between a list view and a grid view.

        Creating dynamic markup. How to create elements and add them to a page.
        document.createElement() takes a tag name as a parameter to create or
        return that element. You use the .appendChild() method to add the
        element or node to the parent element that it is being added to and it
        is always added to the bottom of the list. If you don't want something
        appended to the bottom of the list, use .insertBefore(). The
        .insertBefore() takes two parameters, the new node, and the node you
        want it to go before. Use textContent instead of createTextNode.
        textContent adds a text node to an element without the need to append
        it. To remove a child element use .removeChild() from the parent
        element. The .replaceChild() can be used to replace one node with
        another.
      </p>
      <p>
        The innerHTML can be used to insert HTML code inside an element. To stop
        any malicious content being added to a page unsing innerHTML, any code
        contained with "script" tags is not executed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every element node has a style property. You can JavaScript to add CSS.
        CSS property names that have a '-' must be written in camelCase or use
        bracket notation. Example, background-color become
        .style.backgroundColor or .style['background color']. Limit the
        JavaScript CSS styling and use a CSS in a seperate stylesheet.
      </p>
      <p>
        An event listerner can be added to any element of the DOM. Inline event
        handlers, written in the html page, are not best practice and should be
        avoided. The Event listerners should be in the JavaScript file. The
        addEventListerner() method is called on a node object. It can be called
        without a node, which would be the whole browser window. The first
        parameter is the type of event. The second is a callback function that
        is invoke when the event occours. There is a third parameter, later in
        the chapter. The function does not parentheses after it when it is an
        argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mouse events use click (a click of the mouse button), mousedown (when
        the mouse button is pressed), mouseup (when the mouse button is
        released), dblclick (a double click), mouseover (when the mouse pointer
        is hovering over an element), mouseout (when the mouse pointer moves
        away from the element), and mousemove (when the mouse moves).
      </p>
      <p>
        Keyboard events are keypress, keydown, and keyup. Modifier keys such as
        shift, ctrl, alt, and cmd have keyup and keydown events, but not a
        keypress event because they don't display any thing to the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Touch events are for touch screens and trackpads. Touch events are
        usually made with a finger, but can include a stylus. It is immportant
        to support mouse and touch events because you don't know what device one
        is going to be using. Plus with a mobile first approach, you have to
        consider from phone to desktop.

      <h2>Questions:</h2>
      <p>
        Is "this" similiar to "self" used to define methods in Python classes?
        It seems to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        How much CSS styling do you want to do with JavaScript? I assume little
        as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which is better or the prefered way to use for targeting elements with
        an id, getElementById or querySelector?
