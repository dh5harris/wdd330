        Client-side form validation is an initial check and an important feature
        of a good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side,
        the user can fix it straight away before getting to the server.
        Client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security
        measure, because it is easy to bypass by malicious users. The user gets
        messages for required fields not getting filled in, wrong email, phone,
        password formats and etc. If the information is correctly formatted, the
        data gets sent to the server/database.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three main reasons for form validation. 1) We want to get the
        right data in the right format. 2) We want to protect the users' data
        like secure passwords. 3) We want to protect ourselves from malicious
        users that can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application. There
        are two types of client-side validation; 1) Built-in form validation
        using HTML 5. It is generally better than JavaScript validation, but is
        not as customizable. 2) JavaScript validation uses JavaScript and is
        completely customizable, but you need to create it all or use a library.
      </p>
      <p>
        The built-in HTML 5 validation recap. These are attributes on form
        elements. The required attribute specifices that a form field needs to
        filled in. The minlength and maxlength attributes specifices the minimum
        and maximum length of text data (strings). The min and max attributes
        specifices the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types. The
        type attribute specifices whether the data need to be a number, email
        address, or some other type. The pattern attribute specifices a regular
        expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow. If
        the data enter into the form follow the rules specificed by the above
        attributes, then it is considered valid. If it does not, it is
        considered invalid. When an element is valid it matches the :valid CSS
        pseudo-class, which can be styled to those valid elements and will
        submit the form unless JavaScript prevents it. When an element is
        invalid, it matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class which can be styled
        and the browser will not submit the form and give an error message.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regular expression or regex is a pattern that can used to match
        character combinations in text strings. Regex is great for form
        validation and a variety of ther uses in JavaScript. Some examples of
        regex.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a - matches one character that is a (not b, not aa, and so on)</li>
        <li>abc - matches a, followed by b, followed by c</li>
        <li>
          ab?c - matches a, optionally followed by a single b, followed by c (ac
          or abc)
        </li>
        <li>
          ab*c - matches a, optionally followed by any number of b's, followed
          by c (ac, abc, abbbbc, and so on)
        </li>
        <li>a|b - matches one character that is a or b</li>
        <li>
          abc|xyz - matches exactly abc or exactly xyz (but not abcxyz or a or
          y, and so on)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With validating with JavaScript, you can take control over the look and
        feel of native error messages and/or deal with lagacy browsers that do
        not support HTML's built-in validation. Using the Constraint Validation
        API to check the values that the user has enter in the form. It has the
        following DOM interfaces.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTMLButtonElement (represents a button element)</li>
        <li>HTMLFieldSetElement (represents a fieldset element)</li>
        <li>HTMLInputElement (represents an input element)</li>
        <li>HTMLOutputElement (represents an output element)</li>
        <li>HTMLSelectElement (represents a select element)</li>
        <li>HTMLTextAreaElement (represents a textarea element)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The following properties are available to the above elements. The
        validationMessage returns a string of a localized message describing
        what validation constraints that the control doesn't satisfy. This is
        the empty string if the control is not a candidate for constraint
        validation (willValidate is false), or it satisfies its constraints. The
        willValidate property returns true if the element will be validated when
        the form is submitted. The validity property returns a ValidityState
        object that contains several properties dedcribing the validity state of
        the element. The common ones are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          patternMismatch: returns true if the value does not match the
          specificed pattern, otherwise it is false.
        </li>
        <li>
          tooLong: returns true if the value is longer than the maximum length
          specified by the maxlength attribute, otherwise it is false.
        </li>
        <li>
          tooShort: returns true if the value is shorter than the minimum length
          specified by the minlength attribute, otherwise it is false.
        </li>
        <li>
          rangeOverflow: returns true if the value is greater than the maximum
          specificed by the max attribute, otherwise it is false.
        </li>
        <li>
          ragneUnderflow: returns true if the value is less than the minimum
          specificed by the min attribute, otherwise it is false.
        </li>
        <li>
          typeMismatch: returns true if the value is not in the required syntax
          (when type is email or url), or otherwise it is false.
        </li>
        <li>
          valid: returns true if the elements meet all its validation
          constraints and is considered valid, or false if it fails any
          constraint
        </li>
        <li>
          valueMissing: returns true if the element has a required attribute,
          but there is no value, otherwise it is false.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some methods are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          checkValidity(): returns true if the element's value has no validity
          problems; false otherwise. If the element is invalid, this method
          fires an invalid event on the method.
        </li>
        <li>
          reportValidity(): reports invalid field(s) using events. Useful when
          combined with preventDefault() in a onSubmit event handler.
        </li>
        <li>
          setCustomValidity(message): adds a custom error message to the
          element. This method allows you to use JavaScript code to establish a
          validation failure other than what is offered by HTML 5.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The way HTML 5 form validation error messages are displayed are decided
        by the browser. There is no standard way to style them with CSS.
        Depending on the browser locale, the page can be in one language and the
        error message in another. Customizing these error messages is one of the
        most common use cases of the constraint validation API. To turn off the
        browser's automatic validation, add the novalidate attribute to the form
        element opening tag. It stops the form from showing its own error
        message bubbles and allows ues to instead deisplay the custom error
        messages in the DOM in some manner of own own choosing. For legacy
        broswers, you can't use the constraint validation API or the HTML 5
        built-in form validation. For that you will have to build your own using
        JavaScript to validate the form.
