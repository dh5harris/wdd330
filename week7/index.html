        Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE 'iffy') is an anonymous
        function that is invoked as soon as it is defined by placeing the () at
        the end of the function definition. The IFFE has to be made into an
        expression where the whole function declaration is placed inside (). The
        IIFE has its own private scope.

        A recursive function is one that calls itself until a certian condition
        is met. Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous
        programming. JavaScript is single-threaded, one piece of code or one
        task is processed at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another
        function. This tachnique allows a function to call another function. A
        callback function can run after another function has finished.
        JavaScript functions are executed in the sequence they are called. Not
        in the sequence they are difined. Callback hell, or nested callbacks, is
        where you deal with a callback that is in another callback that is in
        another callback. Don't nest functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        A promise represents the future result of an asychronous operation.
        Promises have 3 states; 1, "pending" or working on getting the result,
        2, "fulfilled" when it has returned a value or completed successfully,
        and 3, "rejected" when the result is an error or didn't complete
        successfully. The promise results are undefined for pending, a result
        value for fulfilled, and an error object for rejected. To create a
        promise, you use a constructor function. Once a promise has been
        resolved or settled, the then() method can be used to deal with the
        outcome. The then() accepts two arguments. The first argument is the
        fulfillment function when the promise is fulfilled. The second argument
        is the rejection function for when the promise is rejected. You can also
        chain a catch() method to the then(), which can be used to specify what
        to do if the operation fails instead.
      </p>

        Async functions, ES2017, are functions that have async keyword before
        the function keyword. This allows you to write asynchronous code as if
        it was synchronous. This is achieved by using the await operator before
        an asynchronous function is called. You can have functions that return
        functions. To make use of those functions that are returned, they need
        to be assigned to a variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        A closure is a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope
        of another function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of
        the program. So the inner function has access to the outter function's
        scope, variables, and so forth. Closures can also change the values of
        the parent function's variables. A closure is formed when the inner
        function is returned by the outter function.
