      <h3>Doing Stuff Book</h3>
      <p>
        I like the way that the author, Lee S. Barney, explains some of the
        details of setting variables and writing functions. When you want to get
        what the user typed in the input and textarea elements, use the .value
        for that element.
      </p>
      <p>
        localStorage - You can store any information you want to use later. Even
        after the user has closed and reopened the browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        localStorage is stored in key:value pairs. When storing or setting an
        item in localStorage, you use .setItem(key, value). You have to have
        both the key and the value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Is localStorage the best option or the most effient way to store
        information? When would you not use localStorage?

      <h3>Master Mobile UX - video</h3>
      <p>
        This video covers the importance of having a mobile first design in
        every aspect with every website and app. Over half of web traffic comes
        from mobile since 2013. It is worth the investment to create a mobile
        first design. Keep it simple, easy to use and navigate. That applies to
        everything from ads, things with in reach, displaying the proper
        keyboard, to clicking a phone number. And the most important thing is to
        not use pop-up ads... like never ever.
