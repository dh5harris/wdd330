      I like the way that the author, Lee S. Barney, explains some of the
      details of setting variables and writing functions. When you want to get
      what the user typed in the input and textarea elements, use the .value for
      that element.
    </p>
    <p>
      localStorage - You can store any information you want to use later. Even
      after the user has closed and reopened the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      localStorage is stored in key:value pairs. When storing or setting an item
      in localStorage, you use .setItem(key, value). You have to have both the
      key and the value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Is localStorage the best option or the most effient way to store
      information? When would you not use localStorage?
